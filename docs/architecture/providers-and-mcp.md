# Providers and MCP

## Provider abstraction

Kineto separates model invocation from workflow logic.

Provider categories:

- LLM
- image
- video
- TTS
- embedding
- vision/evaluation
- local process
- custom HTTP

The workflow engine asks for capabilities, not vendor names.

Provider interfaces stay typed, but Kineto should not pay for runtime dynamic dispatch or boxed futures before a real plugin boundary requires it. Built-in providers should initially use concrete types or enum/static dispatch.

Conceptual Rust interface for a statically dispatched provider:

```rust
pub trait LlmProvider {
    fn capabilities(&self) -> LlmCapabilities;
    fn estimate_cost(&self, request: &LlmRequest) -> Result<CostEstimate>;
    fn generate(
        &self,
        request: LlmRequest,
    ) -> impl Future<Output = Result<LlmResponse>> + Send;
}
```

Equivalent capability-oriented interfaces exist for image, video, and TTS.

This sketch is deliberately not `dyn`-compatible. If runtime-loaded providers later require object safety, introduce an explicit adapter at that boundary and measure its allocation/dispatch cost. Do not make `async_trait`, boxed futures, or trait objects the default architecture merely for stylistic uniformity.

Provider core requests/responses are typed Rust data. `serde_json::Value` or other untyped maps may exist at a vendor HTTP serialization edge when an API requires them, but they are not the workflow/provider hot-path model.

## Capability models

Provider portability depends on describing what a provider can actually preserve.

Image capabilities should cover at least:

- aspect ratios and resolution limits
- seed support and determinism guarantees
- negative prompts
- reference images and reference roles (identity / style / composition)
- reference-count limits
- inpainting/mask support
- output formats

Video capabilities should cover at least:

- text-to-video and image-to-video modes
- min/max duration and fps options
- start/end-frame conditioning
- camera control: none / textual / parametric
- character/identity consistency mechanisms
- async job support and resumable remote handles
- output formats/containers

TTS capabilities should cover at least:

- voice identity/reference support
- language/locale
- style/emotion controls
- pacing/rate controls
- timing metadata
- streaming vs async generation

Cross-cutting capability metadata includes cost model, concurrency/rate limits, retry semantics, and known provider policy constraints where useful for preflight.

## Initial provider support

Recommended first-wave support:

### LLM

- OpenAI API
- Anthropic API
- OpenAI-compatible API
- Ollama / local OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- optional CLI adapters for Codex/Claude-style tools

CLI adapters are experimental. Agent CLIs are not stable substitutes for inference APIs and must follow ADR-0003 process-spawn restrictions.

### Image / video

Start with one cloud provider and one local path.

Local generation should be implementable through a process/API adapter such as ComfyUI without coupling core workflow logic to it.

### TTS

Support:

- one production-quality cloud provider
- one local provider
- custom HTTP endpoint

Voice metadata belongs to character production memory.

## Model router and fallback policy

Provider selection supports:

- explicit user selection
- per-capability default
- project-level override
- task-level override
- fallback chain

Example:

```text
video.generate
  preferred: provider-a/model-x
  fallback: provider-b/model-y
```

The router checks required capabilities before fallback. A fallback that cannot preserve a required identity/reference constraint must refuse or require explicit degraded-generation approval.

Fallback policy is configuration, not prose. It must explicitly govern whether paid fallback is allowed and any spend ceiling/approval requirement.

## Prompt compiler

Do not store only a single raw prompt and do not return only a string from compilation.

Store structured intent and compile it for each provider:

```text
Shot Intent
   ↓
Provider Prompt Compiler
   ├── Provider A compiled request
   ├── Provider B compiled request
   └── Local model compiled request
```

A conceptual compilation result:

```rust
pub struct CompiledPrompt {
    pub prompt: String,
    pub applied_constraints: Vec<ConstraintId>,
    pub dropped_constraints: Vec<DroppedConstraint>,
    pub degradation: DegradationLevel, // none | cosmetic | identity_affecting
    pub compiler_version: String,
}
```

Rules:

- every dropped constraint has a reason
- non-empty dropped constraints are visible before generation
- `identity_affecting` degradation is blockable by policy
- the artifact records the drop list, degradation level, compiler version, and compiled provider input verbatim
- `prompt_hash` includes structured intent, compiler version, and compiled provider input

Input may include:

- visual style
- framing
- lens
- camera motion
- action
- emotion
- character locks
- location locks
- continuity state
- negative constraints
- provider capability hints

This layer is a major piece of Kineto's model portability.

## Paid job safety

A paid/asynchronous provider call has a deterministic idempotency key derived from semantic `input_hash` plus operation identity.

The engine persists a write-ahead intent record before invoking the provider. When supported, it persists the provider's remote job handle (`provider_job_id`) immediately and reconciles it on restart rather than issuing a duplicate call.

Adapters declare:

- cost-estimation support
- concurrency ceiling
- rate-limit/backoff policy
- retryable vs terminal error classification
- remote-job recovery capability

Batch generation has a dry-run/preflight path that can report call count and estimated cost before spend.

## Deterministic fake providers

The same provider interfaces must support offline deterministic fakes with configurable:

- success
- injected latency
- transient failure then success
- terminal failure
- capability-limited behavior

These fakes are required for workflow, retry, dropped-constraint, and migration tests without provider spend.

## MCP role

MCP belongs in the tools/context layer, not as the only LLM abstraction.

Good MCP use cases:

- RAG and external references
- filesystem tools
- Blender
- asset databases
- production databases
- prompt libraries
- custom studio tools
- external metadata sources

Architecture:

```text
               kineto-core
              /          \
     Provider adapters    MCP clients
            │                 │
       model APIs        tools/context
```

The core workflow remains functional without MCP. MCP output is untrusted data and cannot authorize provider spend, arbitrary process execution, or unrestricted filesystem writes.

## Secrets

Secrets are stored outside project files.

Recommended strategy:

- OS keychain / secure credential store for desktop
- environment variables for development/CLI
- local encrypted settings fallback only if platform secure storage is unavailable

Never write API keys or authentication material into:

- project files
- logs
- generated prompt files
- issue reports
- exported artifacts
- telemetry

Secret-redaction behavior requires automated tests.
