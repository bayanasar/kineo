# Production Pipeline

## Principle

Generation is not a single linear call. It is a sequence/graph of artifacts with explicit human approval boundaries.

The stages below define Kineto's **default filmmaking recipe**, not a hardcoded engine state machine. Projects may import an existing screenplay, skip voice, insert extra approvals, or use a future custom recipe. The engine should execute validated step/dependency data rather than require code changes for every workflow variation.

A recipe records an ID/version in the project so provenance includes the workflow definition used.

## Stage 1 — Ingest

Inputs:

- plain text
- Markdown
- document-imported text
- later: EPUB/PDF/document connectors

Outputs:

- normalized source
- source metadata
- optional semantic index

## Stage 2 — Story analysis

Extract:

- characters
- locations
- time period
- major events
- relationships
- tone
- themes
- candidate scenes

The result is structured project state, not only prose.

## Stage 3 — Screenplay

The screenplay agent produces:

- screenplay JSON
- human-readable screenplay Markdown

The user can:

- edit
- regenerate sections
- split/merge scenes
- reorder scenes
- approve and lock a revision

Downstream generation references explicit scene/sub-artifact revisions rather than invalidating every shot for cosmetic screenplay changes.

## Stage 4 — World and character bible

Generate reusable production entities:

- characters
- locations
- props
- visual constraints
- continuity constraints

Character records contain both semantic descriptions and concrete visual references.

## Stage 5 — Style exploration

Use tested pre-prompts/templates to generate a small number of style directions.

User actions:

- select
- refine
- reject
- lock

A locked style becomes part of the production context for later visual generations.

## Stage 6 — Character casting

Generate candidate appearances per important character.

Once selected, create a character reference pack rather than storing only one portrait.

Recommended references:

- canonical portrait
- front view
- left/right profile
- full body
- costume
- expression samples

The selected references become production memory. Selection points to stable candidate IDs; files are not renamed to `selected.*`.

## Stage 7 — Voice casting

Voice belongs to the character definition when dialogue/voice is used by the recipe.

The user can choose:

- voice provider
- voice identity
- tone
- pacing
- accent/style constraints

Dialogue duration may affect shot design, so voice planning happens before final shot rendering when applicable, even if audio files are generated lazily.

## Stage 8 — Scene breakdown and shot planning

For each scene, generate explicit shots with:

- dramatic purpose
- shot type
- framing
- lens
- camera motion
- subject action
- dialogue
- emotion
- duration target
- continuity requirements

The intent remains expressive even if a target provider cannot preserve every field.

## Stage 9 — Keyframes first

Do not immediately render multiple expensive videos.

Default flow:

```text
Shot plan
  ↓
3–4 keyframe candidates
  ↓
user selects/refines
  ↓
selected keyframe artifact ID
  ↓
video generation
```

This reduces cost and improves visual consistency.

## Stage 10 — Video candidates

The prompt compiler builds provider-specific input from:

```text
shot intent
+ character locks
+ location locks
+ style lock
+ previous shot state
+ selected keyframe
+ continuity constraints
```

Compilation reports applied and dropped constraints plus degradation severity before generation. Identity-affecting degradation can be blocked by policy.

Before paid batches, the user can see cost/call-count preflight where provider metadata supports it.

The user may:

- select
- refine
- regenerate
- branch a variant
- lock

## Stage 11 — Preference learning

The first version should not train a model.

Maintain an interpretable director preference profile:

```json
{
  "camera_motion": {
    "prefer": ["slow dolly"],
    "avoid": ["handheld"]
  },
  "lighting": {
    "prefer": ["low-key", "practical"]
  },
  "performance": {
    "intensity": 0.35
  }
}
```

Candidate choices can update this profile after an LLM/vision comparison explains what differs between accepted and rejected candidates.

The profile informs future candidate generation.

## Stage 12 — Export

Kineto exports production-ready shot packages, not a finished edit.

The minimum deliverable is not just bare numbered files. Every exported media asset has a metadata sidecar, and the package has a project-level manifest with shot order and scene grouping.

Representative package:

```text
export/
├── manifest.json
├── S003_SH01.mp4
├── S003_SH01.json
├── S003_SH01.wav
├── S003_SH02.mp4
├── S003_SH02.json
└── S003_SH02.wav
```

A shot sidecar includes at least:

```json
{
  "shot_id": "S003_SH01",
  "scene_id": "S003",
  "artifact_id": "01J...",
  "duration": 5.5,
  "fps": 24,
  "resolution": "1920x1080",
  "provider": "...",
  "model": "...",
  "seed": 12345,
  "compiled_prompt": "...",
  "source_keyframe": "01J...",
  "characters": ["alice"],
  "locked_at": "..."
}
```

The project manifest includes scene grouping, shot order, selected artifact IDs, filenames, and total runtime. This makes the handoff useful without reopening Kineto.

Later ecosystem exports can add:

- OTIO
- EDL
- NLE-specific metadata
