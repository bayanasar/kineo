# MVP Roadmap

## Cross-cutting product rules

### WabiSabi is the Flutter UI system

All Kineto Flutter UI consumes WabiSabi from `https://github.com/bayanasar/wabisabi.git` for reusable components, themes, and design tokens.

Kineto must not grow a parallel local design system. Product screens may contain Kineto content, state, composition, project data, and feature-specific dimensions; reusable UI primitives and reusable visual rules belong upstream in WabiSabi.

When Kineto exposes a missing reusable widget/token/toolkit capability, implement it in WabiSabi, update WabiSabi's example/showcase and tests, then upgrade the Kineto consumer. See [WabiSabi UI Consumer Playbook](../playbooks/wabisabi-ui-consumer.md).

### Native resources are first-class

Desktop Flutter and Rust are one application. Ordinary Flutter↔Rust calls use typed in-process FFI per ADR-0005; do not add JSON-RPC, localhost, stdio framing, or a daemon to the desktop path without a measured requirement.

Rust owns production compute and machine-local orchestration. Large media stays in files/native memory where possible instead of being copied through Dart. Reliability comes from durable job state and reconciliation rather than keeping an engine process alive at all costs.

## P0 — Foundation

Goal: prove the local application architecture before adding generation.

Deliverables:

- Flutter shell consuming WabiSabi
- Rust `kineto-core` library
- typed native FFI boundary with explicit ownership
- Flutter build hook that compiles/bundles Rust as a Code Asset
- project create/open
- project folder layout
- schema validation
- SQLite local index
- job model
- asset registry
- settings and secret storage abstraction
- deterministic fake provider seam
- at least one committed golden project fixture

Testing strategy:

- `cargo fmt`, clippy with warnings denied, and workspace tests
- actual Flutter FFI smoke test against the bundled Rust CodeAsset
- workflow/artifact-state tests run offline with zero provider spend
- fake adapters cover deterministic success, latency, transient failure, terminal failure, and capability limits
- golden projects cover schema validation, DB reconstruction, invalidation, and migration
- `.kineto/` deletion/rebuild tests assert durable selections, locks, provenance, and dependencies survive

Interactive checkpoint now available on the bootstrap branch:

```text
Local demo project
  → Scene 001 / Shot 001
  → generate 3 deterministic candidates
  → select / reselect
  → lock
  → close and reopen the native engine
  → selection and lock remain
```

This checkpoint uses the real Rust artifact lifecycle, typed FFI, and WabiSabi UI. Its four-byte demo persistence is intentionally disposable scaffolding, not the final canonical project serializer and not a provider implementation.

Exit criteria:

- desktop app loads the Rust library in-process without an external engine executable
- no JSON/RPC/string-dispatch layer exists on the desktop native boundary
- Rust can create/read/update canonical project state
- app restart can reconstruct durable state and reconcile unfinished jobs
- deleting derived local index/cache does not change durable production truth
- Flutter UI uses WabiSabi for theme/tokens/reusable components

## P0.5 — Narrow vertical slice

Goal: validate abstract schemas against one real generation path before generalizing further.

Build one deliberately narrow path from a short source/scene through one provider chain to one generated video shot. Task-specific code is acceptable when it exposes real shot intent, provider capability, artifact dependency, approval, cost, and memory/copy semantics.

The P0 interactive checkpoint proves local approval-state ergonomics before provider spend. P0.5 replaces the deterministic demo candidates with one real provider chain while preserving the same select/reselect/lock UX and Rust-owned state boundary.

Profile the slice on Apple Silicon and at least one x86_64 desktop before adding extra process boundaries, worker pools, bulk bridge copies, or caches.

## P1 — Source to screenplay

Deliverables:

- source import
- LLM provider abstraction
- one cloud provider
- one OpenAI-compatible/local provider
- story analysis schema
- screenplay generation
- screenplay review/editor
- revision and lock model
- write-ahead job intent + idempotency key
- provider retry/rate-limit/error-classification policy
- generation cost preflight/dry-run

Exit criteria:

- user imports source text
- generates screenplay
- edits/reviews it
- locks a screenplay revision

## P2 — Style and characters

Deliverables:

- world/character bible
- image provider abstraction
- explicit image capability model
- style preset system
- style candidate generation
- character candidate generation
- character reference packs
- style and character locking
- prompt compilation result with applied/dropped constraints and degradation level

Exit criteria:

- user can lock a visual style and canonical cast

## P3 — Scene planning and keyframes

Deliverables:

- scene breakdown
- shot schema
- declarative workflow recipe/step schema
- default recipe reproducing the documented production pipeline
- shot planner
- continuity context builder
- keyframe generation
- candidate compare/select/refine UI
- semantic input hashing and explainable staleness at sub-artifact granularity

Exit criteria:

- locked screenplay can produce a reviewed shot list and selected keyframes

## P4 — Video generation and production handoff

Deliverables:

- video provider abstraction
- explicit video capability model
- provider-specific prompt compiler
- candidate generation
- refine/branch flow
- local asset download/storage
- selected-shot workflow
- retention classes and dependency-aware media GC with dry-run
- content-addressed generated-media dedupe
- per-shot export sidecars
- project-level JSON export manifest with shot ordering and scene grouping

Exit criteria:

- user can produce and lock scene video shots into the project folder
- user can export a self-describing production package without reopening Kineto
- project disk use can be controlled without collecting locked artifacts or required ancestry

This is the first useful alpha boundary.

## P5 — Voice and preferences

Deliverables:

- TTS abstraction
- explicit TTS capability model
- voice casting
- dialogue duration metadata
- voice generation
- director preference profile
- preference updates from candidate choices

Exit criteria:

- characters have stable voices
- future shot proposals reflect user preferences

## P6 — Ecosystem and advanced interchange

Deliverables:

- OTIO/EDL export
- custom provider plugins
- MCP tool connections
- optional local-web/daemon transport **only if a demonstrated use case requires it**
- schema-generated binary transport for that mode; desktop FFI remains unchanged
- external asset integrations

## Explicitly deferred

Do not build before the core production workflow proves useful:

- timeline editor
- transitions
- color grading
- compositing
- subtitle editor
- music editor
- cloud project hosting
- collaboration server
- model marketplace
- training/ranking models from user preference data
